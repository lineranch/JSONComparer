NOTES:
    The python library scipy is needed for this script!

ASSUMPTIONS:
    The JSON files are in the same directory as the python script
    Similarity will be calculated based on values, arrays, and objects; not necessarily how the document is formatted
    The script will be printing the result, not returning
    Only two scripts can be compared at a time
